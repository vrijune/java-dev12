/**
 * Simple GUI program to show an animation of shapes. Class AnimationViewer is
 * a special kind of GUI component (JPanel), and as such an instance of 
 * AnimationViewer can be added to a JFrame object. A JFrame object is a
 * window that can be closed, minimised, and maximised. The state of a
 * AnimationViewer object comprises a list of Shapes and a Timer object. An
 * AnimationViewer instance subscribes to events that are published by a Timer.
 * In response to receiving an event from the Timer, the AnimationViewer iterates
 * through a list of Shapes requesting that each Shape paints and moves itself.
